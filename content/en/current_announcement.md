title: Witnet is now side-chanined to Ethereum 
description: 'Witnet is a separate blockchain. However, communication between Ethereum and Witnet is enabled via the Witnet Bridge Interface and the bridge nodes; these nodes operate in both blockchains and get randomly selected to perform the job of relaying requests and responses back and forth between the chains.'
